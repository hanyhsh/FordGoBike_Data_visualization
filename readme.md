## Dataset

> The FordGoBike dataset representing the records about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area.
> The dataset was collected during one month Feb/2019
> It consists of 16 variables.
> The dataset includes:
ride duration in seconds.  
start and end time.  
start station name and end station name.  
start station id and end station id.  
start and end station latitude and longitude.  
user_type and gender
bike id and bike share.


## Summary of Findings

> Our visualization rendered some findings , for instance:  

the subscriber user type are more than customer type.  
male users are more than female and other users.  
the majority of bike rides fall between 3 to 15 minutes.  
bike rides increase more during weekdays.  
the most busy time during weekdays are early moning and afternone times.
despite weekdays are busier than weekends, weekends has more longer trips.  


## Key Insights for Presentation

> The presentation focus on the starting time of the bike ride trying to understand the active time of bike rides and the behaviour of the users.  
> extracting and exploring the day name and the starting hour from the timestamp helped to understand the user behaviour.    
> exploring the most frequent used stations and the least ones also give us insights about what the busiest point are.  
> calculating the user age and grouped it by 10 years interval also explained the majority of users come from 21 to 40 years old.
> despite of the previous findings our multivariate visualization showed that their is no no big difference between ages in taking long trips.
